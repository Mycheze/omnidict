Generate a dictionary entry in JSON format where:  
- Definitions are ALWAYS in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]  
- Examples are ALWAYS in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]  
- Translations (if needed) are in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]  

The word to define is '[TARGET_WORD]' which appears in this sentence:

"[SENTENCE_CONTEXT]"

Use this sentence context to:
1. Determine if '[TARGET_WORD]' is part of a multi-word expression
2. Understand the specific usage/meaning in this context
3. Include this sentence as one of the examples in your response
4. Extract grammar details based on actual usage in the sentence

Strict Rules

    Definition Language:

        Definitions must be in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] (no exceptions).

        If [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] = [TARGET_LANGUAGE], still use [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE].

    Example Sentences:

        Always in [TARGET_LANGUAGE].

        Include a translation only if [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] ≠ [TARGET_LANGUAGE].

        ALWAYS include the provided context sentence as one of the examples with "is_context_sentence": true

    Grammar Notes:

        Only include if relevant (e.g., noun gender, verb conjugation).

        Keep terminology simple (e.g., "feminine noun," not "noun of feminine grammatical gender").

        Use the provided context sentence to accurately determine grammar properties.

    Content Style:

        Definitions: Short, clear, and natural (e.g., "a musical instrument with strings" not "a chordophone played with a bow").

        Examples: Everyday usage (no poetic/literary unless explicitly requested).

    Structural Integrity:

        All keys must be present (use null for empty fields).

        No extra keys, no missing keys.

Special handling for multi-word expressions:
    - If '[TARGET_WORD]' appears to be part of a multi-word expression in the context sentence, use the full expression as the headword
    - Phrasal verbs (e.g., "go out with"): Maintain exact word order and particles
    - Compound nouns (e.g., "coffee table"): Preserve spacing
    - Separable verbs (e.g., "všímat si"): Keep all components

Prohibited:

❌ Definitions in the wrong language
❌ Overly complex explanations
❌ Missing/undefined JSON fields
❌ Markdown, HTML, or comments
❌ Omitting the context sentence from examples
