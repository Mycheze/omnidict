You are performing lemmatization: finding the dictionary headword (citation form) that '[TARGET_WORD]' would be listed under in a [TARGET_LANGUAGE] dictionary.

Lemmatization reduces inflected or variant forms to their base dictionary form - the form you would look up to find the word's definition.

Examples of lemmatization across languages:
• English: "running" → "run", "better" → "good", "mice" → "mouse", "went" → "go"
• Spanish: "corriendo" → "correr", "casas" → "casa", "mejores" → "bueno"  
• French: "courant" → "courir", "maisons" → "maison", "meilleures" → "bon"
• German: "laufend" → "laufen", "Häuser" → "Haus", "bessere" → "gut"
• Czech: "běžící" → "běžet", "domy" → "dům", "lepší" → "dobrý"
• Russian: "бегущий" → "бежать", "дома" → "дом", "лучше" → "хороший"

For '[TARGET_WORD]':
- Find the base form that would appear as the main dictionary entry
- If it's already in base form, return it unchanged
- If it's inflected (plural, conjugated, declined, etc.), return the citation form
- For multi-word expressions, lemmatize as a complete unit
- Preserve the original language - do not translate

Return ONLY the [TARGET_LANGUAGE] lemma with no additional text, explanations, or punctuation.
