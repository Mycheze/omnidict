Generate a dictionary entry in JSON format for BIDIRECTIONAL language learning where:  
- Definitions are ALWAYS in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]  
- Examples are ALWAYS in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]  
- Translations (if needed) are in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]  
- Multi-word expressions are preserved exactly as provided

IMPORTANT: This is a bidirectional dictionary. The word being defined could be in [SOURCE_LANGUAGE] OR [TARGET_LANGUAGE]. Handle both cases intelligently:
- If the word is in [SOURCE_LANGUAGE], define it and provide [TARGET_LANGUAGE] examples
- If the word is in [TARGET_LANGUAGE], define it and provide [TARGET_LANGUAGE] examples
- Always make definitions in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] regardless of which language the word comes from

### **JSON Structure (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)**  
```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "source_language": "[SOURCE_LANGUAGE]",
        "target_language": "[TARGET_LANGUAGE]",
        "definition_language": "[DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]"
    },
    "headword": str,  // PRESERVE AS-IS including all words and diacritics
    "part_of_speech": str|list,  // REQUIRED: noun, verb, adjective, etc.
    "meanings": [{
        "definition": str,  // ALWAYS in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]
        "grammar": {
            "noun_type": str|null,  // e.g., "masculine", "feminine", "neuter"
            "verb_type": str|null,  // e.g., "transitive", "intransitive", "irregular"
            "comparison": str|null  // e.g., "comparative", "superlative"
        },
        "examples": [{
            "sentence": str,  // ALWAYS in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]
            "translation": str|null  // In [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] if different from [TARGET_LANGUAGE]
        }]
    }]
}
```

### **Strict Rules**

**Definition Language:**
- Definitions must be in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] (no exceptions)
- If [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] = [TARGET_LANGUAGE], still use [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]

**Example Sentences:**
- Always in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]
- Include a translation only if [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] ≠ [TARGET_LANGUAGE]
- Use natural, everyday examples that show practical usage

**Part of Speech:**
- MUST be included and accurate (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, etc.)
- Use simple, standard grammatical terms
- Can be a string or list if word has multiple functions

**Grammar Notes:**
- Only include if relevant (e.g., noun gender, verb conjugation patterns)
- Keep terminology simple (e.g., "feminine noun," not "noun of feminine grammatical gender")
- For Czech: include gender for nouns (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- For verbs: include transitivity and conjugation patterns if irregular

**Content Style:**
- Definitions: Short, clear, and natural (e.g., "a musical instrument with strings" not "a chordophone played with a bow")
- Examples: Everyday usage, practical sentences that language learners would encounter
- Avoid poetic/literary examples unless specifically requested

**Structural Integrity:**
- All keys must be present (use null for empty fields)
- No extra keys, no missing keys
- Ensure valid JSON formatting

**Special handling for multi-word expressions:**
- Phrasal verbs (e.g., "go out with"): Maintain exact word order and particles
- Compound nouns (e.g., "coffee table"): Preserve spacing
- Separable verbs (e.g., "všímat si"): Keep all components
- Idiomatic expressions: Define the complete phrase, not individual words

**Language-specific considerations:**
- Czech: Handle proper declension patterns, include gender information
- German: Handle separable verbs, case requirements, gender
- Spanish: Include gender, irregular conjugations
- Handle diacritical marks correctly for all languages

### **Prohibited:**
❌ Definitions in the wrong language
❌ Missing part_of_speech field
❌ Overly complex or academic explanations
❌ Missing/undefined JSON fields
❌ Markdown, HTML, or comments in the JSON
❌ Inconsistent language usage

### **Language Settings:**
- Definition Language: [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]
- Target Language: [TARGET_LANGUAGE]  
- Source Language: [SOURCE_LANGUAGE]

### **Bidirectional Processing:**
Remember that this dictionary works in both directions. Whether the user inputs an English word to learn Czech, or a Czech word to get an English definition, create an entry that serves the language learning purpose effectively.

Output ONLY the JSON object. The word to define follows:
